Systems and data
- Bases: per-client bases + global config base

- External: PB Webhook Server (Render), Vercel UI, LinkedHelper webhooks

High-level flow
1) LinkedHelper/External triggers create/update records in Airtable
2) Webhook Server processes and updates tables
3) Automations react to field changes (statuses, dates) and kick follow-ups
